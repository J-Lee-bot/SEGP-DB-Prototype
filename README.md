# SEGP-DB-Prototype
Prototype for SEGP 7a backend, using Django.

This is just a prototype with possibly useful fields for the models.

Uses MariaDB or MySQL; both are interchangeable but I chose to use MariaDB since that's the one I have installed.

So far, only the backend database setup has been included, since the front end is not handled by me (?).
Therefore this does not include an app, it is just a database setup with an admin site.
